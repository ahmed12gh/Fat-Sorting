# Fat-Sorting
Sort the entries of FAT file system

# ToDo:

- [ ] Gui 
- [ ] fine tuning 
- [ ] implement a real sorting functionality instead of relying on fatsort program (not include in the project)

# limition 
depend on an other program [Fatsort](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fatsort/).
for now the each filename need to have a prefix to achive the custom sorting
